# 👋 Hi there! I'm Luis Diaz-Restrepo

I'm a Full Stack Web Developer passionate about creating user-focused, responsive, and scalable web applications.

💡 I enjoy building modern interfaces using **React** and **Redux Toolkit**, while connecting them to robust backends built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **PostgreSQL**. My journey started with WordPress and WooCommerce, and now I'm focused on building software solutions with solid fundamentals and great user experiences.
